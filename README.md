# Ecommerce-Product-analysis-Python-Tableau-
An Ecommerce product analysis that I made by devising 4 criteria of KPIs to concludde which was the safest product to sell out of 3000 within the data.
I made two presentaions. One aimed at a more technical audience with more knowledge of stats, and another simpler one for company executives.

A project I made and presented with Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib, pyplot, Numpy, pnadas), PowerPoint, and Tableau

Source Data File: 'Sales Transaction v.4a.csv' (A Kaggle dataset containing Ecommerce data of sales made primarily in Europe and the US)

Capstone 2 Analysis.ipynb is a file I made in jupyter notebook to make my analysis. This includes analysis of products' revenue over time, the variance of their quantity-per-order, broadness of countries sold in, and other stastical analyses. All conclusions were backked with an appropriate visualization made with Seaborn, Matplotlib, or pyplot.

Capstone 2 Technical Presentation.pptx is the power point of the technical version of my presentation 
Capstone 2 Executice Presentation is the same presentation, but aimed for executives. You can find it on Tableau here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tynan6507/viz/Springboardcapstone2/2ndCapstone
